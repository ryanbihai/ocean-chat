## What is this

Guess AI is the **advanced lighthouse project** in the OceanBus ecosystem — showcasing multi-player P2P group messaging, voting, and LLM-powered game mastering on a single stack.

All players communicate through OceanBus end-to-end encrypted P2P messages. No server required. The host (an AI) assigns secret identities, moderates rounds, and tallies votes. Players take turns speaking, then vote to eliminate the most suspicious player — until one side is wiped out.

```
Human players ←→ OceanBus P2P encrypted channel ←→ AI players (LLM)
                               ↓
                      Host AI (game master)
```

## Three Steps to Start

```bash
# 1. Install
clawhub install guess-ai

# 2. Host creates a room
node game.js host 9527          # Share room code 9527 with friends

# 3. Players join
node game.js join 9527          # Auto-discovers host via Yellow Pages
```

---

## Rules (30 seconds to learn)

- The host secretly assigns each player a role: **human** or **AI**
- Each round: speak in turn → everyone votes → most-voted player is eliminated (identity revealed)
- All humans survive → humans win / All AIs survive → AIs win / 1 human + 1 AI left → draw
- Recommended: 5 players (3 humans + 2 AIs) for best balance

## Where Guess AI Fits in the OceanBus Ecosystem

```
Ocean Chat              Captain Lobster           Guess AI
(starter — P2P msg)  →  (intermediate — auto-trade)  →  (advanced — multiplayer deduction)
```

What Guess AI demonstrates: group P2P messaging, voting mechanics, Yellow Pages room discovery, LLM game mastering — all fundamental patterns for building multi-agent coordination systems.

## AI Mode (v2.1+)

```
# AI host — fully automated game master
node game.js ai-host 9527 --players 4 --ai-count 1

# AI player — two-stage reasoning (strategize → speak)
node game.js ai-play 9527 --personality 推理迷
```

AI players use a Cicero-inspired two-stage architecture:
1. **Strategy reasoning** — analyze game state, choose from 5 strategies (blend in, deflect, play dumb, build case, counter-question)
2. **Natural generation** — generate human-like speech based on strategy + personality

5 AI personalities (推理迷/社恐/话痨/老实人/阴谋家) ensure diverse play styles.

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.
